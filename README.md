# Superconductiong Qubits

This is a repository for the computational exercises for the first interation of the course in superconducting qubits offered at the Niels Bohr Institute. The repositiory is organised by week. So in the week 1 folder you'll find the exercises for that week and the code for solving/plotting the exercises where that is required. Outside of the week folders there's also the full litterature list for the course and the full solution manual.
